# filecrypt

A simple CLI tool for Linux to encrypt and decrypt files in place using XChaCha20-Poly1305 authenticated encryption. It streams data for low memory usage on large files and performs atomic overwrites for safety.

**Note:** This app is designed for Linux only. The requirement for a `key.key` file in the current working directory is intentional for simplicity and security (e.g., avoid passing keys via CLI args).

## Features

- Encrypts/decrypts files atomically (uses a temp file and renames).
- Streams processing in 1MB chunks to handle very large files without high RAM usage.
- Uses libsodium's `crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305` for secure, authenticated streaming encryption.
- Requires a 32-byte key from `key.key` in the current directory.
- Handles empty files and enforces a final authentication tag for integrity.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed (via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)).
2. Clone or create the project:
   ```
   cargo new filecrypt
   cd filecrypt
   ```
3. Add dependencies to `Cargo.toml`:
   ```
   [dependencies]
   sodiumoxide = "0.2.7"
   clap = { version = "4.5", features = ["derive"] }
   anyhow = "1.0"
   ```
4. Copy the provided `src/main.rs` code into the file.
5. Build the release binary:
   ```
   cargo build --release
   ```
   The binary will be at `target/release/filecrypt`.

## Usage

Generate a key (run in the directory where you'll use the tool):
```
head -c 32 /dev/urandom > key.key
```
Protect `key.key` appropriately (e.g., permissions: `chmod 600 key.key`).

### Encrypt a file
```
./target/release/filecrypt enc path/to/file.txt
```

### Decrypt a file
```
./target/release/filecrypt dec path/to/file.txt
```

The file is overwritten in place. Test on copies first!

## Security Notes

- This uses a secure, audited library (libsodium) for cryptography—do not modify the crypto parts unless you're an expert.
- The key is raw bytes; for password-based use, consider deriving it with Argon2 (not implemented here).
- No IV/nonce management needed; XChaCha20 handles it securely via random nonces in the header.
- Always verify decryption works immediately after encryption.
- Not suitable for production without further hardening (e.g., key management, error handling).
